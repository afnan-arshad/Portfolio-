# CSS Learning Playground 🎨

This repository contains my **CSS learning journey** with small example projects, practice exercises, and layout experiments.  
I’m using it to build strong fundamentals in CSS and gradually move toward **responsive, modern UI designs**.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside

- ✅ CSS basics (selectors, box model, typography)
- ✅ Layout practice (Flexbox, Grid)
- ✅ Responsive design (media queries, mobile-first)
- ✅ Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, navbars)
- ✅ Mini projects that apply concepts in real examples

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

The goal is to:
- practice CSS consistently
- document my progress with clear examples
- build a foundation for real portfolio projects using Tailwind/React later
